# Terraform-AWS-Project

In This Terraform AWS project! I automated AWS infrastructure using Terraform to deploy two applications in different availability zones, set up a VPC, and configure a load balancer to handle traffic seamlessly.

WE USED TERRAFORM TO:

- **Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets in different availability zones.**
- **Deploy two EC2 instances, each in a separate subnet.**
- **Set Up a Remote Backend with an S3 Bucket for Seamless State Management**
- **Set up a load balancer to distribute traffic between these instances automatically.**

  "With Terraform, infrastructure as code allows us to provision resources consistently and efficiently."

### ***Step 1: Setting Up a Virtual Machine (VM) to Run Terraform***
First we need a reliable environment to execute Terraform commands. I accomplished this by provisioning an EC2 instance with the following configuration:
- Instance Type: t2.medium (2 vCPUs, 4 GiB memory)
- Storage: 15 GiB of gp3 SSD

Once the EC2 instance was up and running, I performed the following steps:
#### 1. Updated the System and Installed AWS CLI and Terraform on the Machine.
``` shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# aws cli
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

# install Terraform
wget -O - https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
```

- Official Documentation of Terraform: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install
#### 2. Created an IAM User with necessary permissions and generated access keys.

#### 3. Configured AWS CLI with the access key, secret key, and region to enable secure access to AWS services for Terraform.
Finally, I configured the AWS CLI on the EC2 instance with the newly created access credentials:
``` shell
aws configure
```

### ***Step 2: Write Provider.tf file to define the provider***
In This provider.tf file is essential for connecting Terraform to AWS and managing infrastructure in the specified region.
- terraform Block
``` shell
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.11.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```
terraform Block:
Specifies the AWS provider (hashicorp/aws) and locks its version to 5.11.0 to ensure compatibility.

provider "aws" Block:
Configures the AWS provider to deploy resources in the us-east-1 region.

- provider.tf is typically the first file Terraform reads to know which provider to use and where to deploy resources.
- Once this configuration is in place, other Terraform files (main.tf, variables.tf, etc.) can define the actual AWS infrastructure (like VPCs, subnets, EC2 instances, etc.).

### ***Step 3: Write main.tf configuration to creates an AWS infrastructure with Terraform***
main.tf configuration to creates an AWS infrastructure with Terraform, including a VPC, subnets, EC2 instances, an internet gateway, a security group, a load balancer, and other resources necessary for a web application deployment.
#### 1. Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
``` shell
resource "aws_vpc" "myvpc" {
  cidr_block = var.cidr
}
```
- aws_vpc resource creates a VPC.
- CIDR Block: The IP address range of the VPC is defined by the variable var.cidr.
#### 2. Create Subnets in Different Availability Zones
``` shell
resource "aws_subnet" "sub1" {
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.myvpc.id
  cidr_block              = "10.0.0.0/24"
  availability_zone       = "us-east-1a"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
}
```
``` shell
resource "aws_subnet" "sub2" {
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.myvpc.id
  cidr_block              = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone       = "us-east-1b"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
}
```
- Resource: aws_subnet creates two subnets within the VPC.
- CIDR Blocks: Each subnet is assigned a different IP range.
- Availability Zones: sub1 is in us-east-1a, and sub2 is in us-east-1b.
- Public IP: map_public_ip_on_launch is set to true, making instances launched in these subnets accessible from the internet.

#### 3. Create an Internet Gateway
``` shell
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "igw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.myvpc.id
}
```
- Resource: aws_internet_gateway attaches an internet gateway to the VPC, allowing instances to access the internet.

#### 4. Create a Route Table and Associate It with Subnets
``` shell
resource "aws_route_table" "rt" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.myvpc.id

  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.igw.id
  }
}
```
- Route Table: Defines a route to forward all internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the internet gateway.

``` shell
resource "aws_route_table_association" "rta1" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.sub1.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.rt.id
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "rta2" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.sub2.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.rt.id
}
```
- Associations: Link the route table to both subnets.

#### 5. Create a Security Group for Web Servers
``` shell
resource "aws_security_group" "webSg" {
  name   = "web"
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.myvpc.id

  ingress {
    description = "HTTP from VPC"
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    description = "SSH"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```
- Ingress Rules:
-- Allow HTTP traffic on port 80 from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).
-- Allow SSH access on port 22 from anywhere.
- Egress Rules: Allow all outbound traffic.

#### 6. Launch Two EC2 Instances in Different Subnets
``` shell
resource "aws_instance" "webserver1" {
  ami                    = "ami-0866a3c8686eaeeba"
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.webSg.id]
  subnet_id              = aws_subnet.sub1.id
  user_data              = base64encode(file("userdata.sh"))
}
```
``` shell
resource "aws_instance" "webserver1" {
  ami                    = "ami-0866a3c8686eaeeba"
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.webSg.id]
  subnet_id              = aws_subnet.sub1.id
  user_data              = base64encode(file("userdata.sh"))
}
```
- AMI: Amazon Machine Image for the instance.
- Instance Type: t2.micro (free-tier eligible).
- User Data: Custom startup script for each instance.

#### 7. Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
``` shell
resource "aws_lb" "myalb" {
  name               = "myalb"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  security_groups    = [aws_security_group.webSg.id]
  subnets            = [aws_subnet.sub1.id, aws_subnet.sub2.id]
}
```
- Resource: aws_lb creates an ALB to balance traffic between the two instances.

#### 8. Create a Target Group and Attach Instances
``` shell
resource "aws_lb_target_group" "tg" {
  name     = "myTG"
  port     = 80
  protocol = "HTTP"
  vpc_id   = aws_vpc.myvpc.id
}
```
``` shell
resource "aws_lb_target_group_attachment" "attach1" {
  target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.tg.arn
  target_id        = aws_instance.webserver1.id
  port             = 80
}

resource "aws_lb_target_group_attachment" "attach2" {
  target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.tg.arn
  target_id        = aws_instance.webserver2.id
  port             = 80
}
```
- Target Group: Manages the EC2 instances behind the load balancer.
- Attachments: Connects each instance to the target group.
#### 9. Create a Listener for the Load Balancer
``` shell
resource "aws_lb_listener" "listener" {
  load_balancer_arn = aws_lb.myalb.arn
  port              = 80
  protocol          = "HTTP"

  default_action {
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.tg.arn
    type             = "forward"
  }
}
```
- Listener: Listens for incoming HTTP traffic on port 80 and forwards it to the target group.

#### 10. Output the Load Balancer DNS
``` shell
output "loadbalancerdns" {
  value = aws_lb.myalb.dns_name
}
```
- Output: Displays the DNS name of the load balancer after deployment, allowing you to access the application.

### ***Step 4: Write variables.tf configuration to defining the VPC CIDR Block***
This step highlights that the CIDR block for the VPC is being defined as a variable (cidr), allowing flexibility and reusability across different environments or configurations. By setting the default value to 10.0.0.0/16, you're specifying the range of IP addresses available for the VPC.
``` shell
variable "cidr" {
  default = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```
- variable "cidr": Declares a variable named cidr.
- default = "10.0.0.0/16":
-- Specifies a default value for the variable if no other value is provided.
-- In this case, the default CIDR block for the VPC is 10.0.0.0/16. 
-- The /16 subnet mask allows for 65,536 IP addresses (from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255).
