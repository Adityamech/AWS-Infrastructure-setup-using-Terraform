# Terraform-AWS-Project

In This project, I write AWS Infrastructure using Terraform to Create a VPC and deploy 2 applications in different availability zones. We will also create a load balancer to balance the load between the instances automatically.

TERRAFORM WITH AWS PROJECT
Automating Infrastructure and Creating Resources on AWS.

Learn how to use Terraform to automate infrastructure or create resources on AWS.
- Terraform is simple to use if you have a strong foundation in AWS fundamentals.
- Project with CloudChamp focuses on setting up infrastructure using Terraform, including internet gateway, load balancer, public subnet, EC2 instances, and S3 bucket.

- Configuration options for AWS provider can be specified in Terraform
- Hard-coded conditions are not recommended in Terraform configuration, access keys are set using AWS configure command

[32:48]([32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Koabqyopqns&t=1968)) Defining VPC and Subnet in Terraform
- Define VPC ID as AWS VPC.myVPC.ID
- Define CIDR block as 10.0.0.0/24
- Specify AZ as US East 1A
- Set map public IP on launch to true
- Create another subnet with different name and CIDR block

[43:44]([43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Koabqyopqns&t=2624)) Creating a security group in AWS with inbound rules for ports 80 and 22
- Use the AWS security group resource
- Define the name and prefix of the security group as 'web_HG'
- Specify inbound rules for ports 80 and 22

[54:40]([54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Koabqyopqns&t=3280)) Creating and configuring a security group and EC2 instance.
- Modifying and customizing the security group settings.
- Defining the AMI, instance type, security group, subnet, and user data for the EC2 instance.

[1:05:36]([1:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Koabqyopqns&t=3936)) Creating two instances in different security groups and AZs
- Instances are created with a user data script
- Instance metadata can be accessed to get instance ID

[1:27:23]([1:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Koabqyopqns&t=5243)) Creating load balancer and target group using Terraform
- To print load balancer DNS after Terraform execution, use outputs.tf file
- Ensure tags are correctly added and remove any unnecessary tags
- Run Terraform validate and Terraform fmt commands for code validation and formatting
- Execute Terraform plan command to see the resources that will be created
- Run Terraform apply-auto-approve command to start creating load balancer and target group
- Wait for load balancer and target group to become active and healthy
- Make sure the load balancer is associated with the target group and has a load balancer DNS
- After successful setup, test the load balancer by accessing the deployed application
- DevOps engineers can use this project for deploying instances, load balancing, and allowing external access
- Integrate Ansible with Terraform for more complex setups
- Avoid pushing state files to GitHub, and delete resources after completion using Terraform destroy command
