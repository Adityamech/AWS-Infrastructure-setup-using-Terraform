# Terraform-AWS-Project

In This Terraform AWS project! I automated AWS infrastructure using Terraform to deploy two applications in different availability zones, set up a VPC, and configure a load balancer to handle traffic seamlessly.

WE USED TERRAFORM TO:

- **Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets in different availability zones.**
- **Deploy two EC2 instances, each in a separate subnet.**
- **Set Up a Remote Backend with an S3 Bucket for Seamless State Management**
- **Set up a load balancer to distribute traffic between these instances automatically.**

  "With Terraform, infrastructure as code allows us to provision resources consistently and efficiently."
